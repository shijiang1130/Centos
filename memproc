     drop_caches
     Writing to this will cause the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries and inodes from memory, causing that memory to become free.
     To free pagecache:
     echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches 
     To free dentries and inodes: 
     echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
     To free pagecache, dentries and inodes: 
     echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
     As this is a non-destructive operation and dirty objects are not freeable, the user should run `sync`first
